# Project Title: Monitoring heartbeat and satuaration level
 **Description**: We wanted to create a real time heartbeat and saturation measurement device. It will show the userâ€™s heartbeat, the saturation rate furthermore, he will be notified if these measures are abnormal. To use this device, he has to put his finger on the sensor, it will scan his heartbeat and saturation level in the platform. The monitor has also 2 LED which will light if the level of the heart rate or the saturation level is abnormal.
